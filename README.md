# grifstuf

This is the repo for my site's content and custom build scripts. Check out [this site's stack](https://grifstuf.com/blog/this-sites-stack) on my blog for an in depth dive into my thinking on why I build the site this way.

## Setup

```
npm i
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

## Local Development

npm run dev
```
