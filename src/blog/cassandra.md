# Estimating Decision Cost aka the Cassandra Effect

## PS You can't

Have to make a decision between two options? Make the one that makes you more flexible, damn the cost. You can't predict the future and measuring work is already super hard. If you ever have to remove the effects of a restricting choice, that will take longer than changing a flexible choice.

So the answer to "Should we do this?" becomes "Yes" because we know it will break someday and if we can do something to stop that from happening, we should do so. It's about spending money now to save money later, but it is impossible to measure these numbers, so people tend not to want to do that, and then when stuff blows up we are the ones that are Cassandra.
