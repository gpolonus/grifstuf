All horrible puns aside, I really wanted to redo this site with [Svelte]() and [Sapper](), so I am doing it. After seeing a [talk]() by Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte, about how React isn't truly reactive, I knew I had to make the switch. Hopefully by learning more about this framework, I can combine my love of functional programming and making weird stuff.
